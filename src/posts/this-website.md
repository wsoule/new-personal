This website was made with [Sveltekit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction), [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/), [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/), and [langchain vectorstore](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/mongodb_atlas/).

The code is available on [github](https://github.com/wsoule/new-personal)
